I am using the FL Foundry module together with Mythic GM 2e (as implemented in the Mythic GM Foundry module). This is a formatted and cleaned export of the journal.

I create Macce and Phas.

# Macce

Wolfkin Druid. Outcast but arrogant.

> [!info]- Macce’s backstory
>  
> ### Childhood: Outcast
> 
> When the other cubs ran with the pack, you were cast out. Alone, you learned to live off the forest, and that other kin could be more kind than your own. One day, you will find your way home.
> 
> ### Formative Event: Protected The Forest
> 
> You took it upon yourself to protect a forest against the evil and violence of strangers. You lived in the cover of proud trees, one with the beings of the forest.
> 
> ### Formative Event: Unexpected Find
> 
> You found a treasure marked with the sign of your god. You saw this as a sign that your mission was righteous, but others didn't see it the same way. Maybe there is still someone looking for the treasure?
> 
> ## Relationship
> 
> **Phas** is drawn to dark arts and must be kept under close watch. If needed, it’s your duty to stop her.

# Phas

Elfkin Fighter. Arrogant but dangerous fighter.

> [!info]- Phas’ backstory
>  
> ### Childhood: Fighter
> 
> You learned early on that you were talented with weapons. Soon, you were taken on by a warrior who taught you the mysteries of battle. You trained hard and long, and in time you became your master's equal.
> 
> ### Formative Event: Commander
> 
> You commanded a squad of soldiers. Your comrades looked up to you and would die for you. But something happened, maybe you were betrayed, maybe defeated in an ambush. Your comrades fell or fled, but you survived.
> 
> ### Formative Event: Bloody Battle
> 
> You took part in a terrible battle and were badly injured. When dawn broke, your friends had been defeated to the last man, and the enemy had left you to the ravens.
> 
> ### Formative Event: On Horseback
> 
> You learned to ride and signed on as a knight with a lord. You fought in skirmishes, patrolled and guarded the country from enemies.
> 
> ## Relationship
> 
> **Macce** is the weak link of the group. Can you teach him?

# Starting Situation

We start in the southern region of the map, in the **Fangwoods**.

Macce and Phas met during a festival in Macce's home town, in Fangwoods forest. Phas was a traveling drunk sellsword. Macce was eager for adventuring into the wild and communing with nature.

# Scene 1

They decide to journey in the surrounding area together. Macce will show Phas the area. Phas hopes to prove herself.

We move out into the forest the next morning, at 6 AM.

Macce leads the way but he realizes that he's lost himself. He got distracted trying to entertain Phas with stories of the area.

Not wanting to make a fool of himself, he tries his best to reorient and play it cool. This stresses him out (Wits damage).


> [!info]- Lead the way Mishap
> Draws a result from the Hunting Mishaps table
> 
> 1.  **Savage Animal**: A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks you. The GM chooses an animal from [[JournalEntry.Bestiary]].

Phas wants to impress Macce with her hunting prowess. She fails.  

"We both to be doing poorly in impressing each other", Phas remarks to Macce.

They laugh. But their laugh seems to have attracted the attention of a bear.

They hear a roar from the tree line and turn around.

> Reassuring Weak

...but the bear seems weak and sick. It seems as if it's looking for help.

Macce is intrigued. He appraoches the bear and wants to understand what's ailing it.

He's going to use his **Animal Speech** spell to communicate with it.

> [!info]- Animal Speech
> 
> This spell allows you to speak with a mammal. You can ask a number of questions equal to the Power Level of the spell. The animal can tell you what it has seen, heard, or smelled – but they do not perceive the world as humanoids do, so their answers are often hard to interpret. The main advantage is that they never lie.> 

“What ails thee?”

The bear grunts and lets out what seems to be a deep sigh.

"I have been exiled from my cubs. A stronger bear has moved into my territory and taken over.  
  
I have tried to fight it but I was bested."

> [!info]- Fate Chart Question
> 
> **Does the bear ask us to kill this new bear?** _**(Likely)**_  
> **Exceptional Yes!**

The bear continues:  
  
"I know where your village is. I will terrorize it -- I have nothing left to live for! -- unless you kill this interloper!"

Macce is surprised by this cunning demand! He turns to Phas.

What do they decide to do?  
  
Phas would accept it as a challenge.

> [!info]- Fate Chart Question
> 
> **Does Phas accept this challenge (else kill this bear)?** _**(Likely)**_  
> **No!**
> 
  
Phas does not, and instead is bewildered by the audacity of this bear. She draws her longsword and charges the bear.

What would Macce do?  
  
He would want to maintain the balance and not interfere, not killing the other bear or this bear. But the fact that this bear threatened his home pushes him to Phas' side.
  
> [!info]- Fate Chart Question
> 
> **Does Macce agree w Phas? (else defend the Bear)** _**(Very likely)**_  
> **Yes!**

COMBAT!

Phas charges and cuts a deep gash in the bear’s hide, dealing 4 damage.

Macce shoots his his short bow, but the bear move out of the way as it lounges at Phas.

The bear slashes with his massive paw at Phas, dealing 1 damage.

Phas slashes again, but the bear dodges.

Macce misses with his bow.

The bear slashes Phas again, dealing 1 damage.

Phas slashes the bear again, leaving it at just 1 health.

> [!info]- Fate Chart Question
> 
> **Does the bear run away?** _**(Very likely)**_  
> **No!**

There is a moment in the heat of battle when Macce’s eyes meet the bear’s. The wolfkin is still attuned to the animal. In the flurry of blows, arrows, and bloody paws, he steps forward to the bear.

He still has one question to ask from his **Animal Speech**.

He stops Phas and asks the bear:

“Why don’t you just leave and move somewhere else?”

The bear grunts, letting out a warm breath in the morning crisp air.

I’d rather die now than run away in defeat. This is my land. I will fight for it!

Macce is touched by this. He cannot bring the death blow on the animal. He turns away. The bear grunts one last battle cry …

… and is downed by Phas' longsword.

Macce: "A shame we had kill such a magnificent creature"

Phas: "Well, imagine how magnificent the other bear must be."

End of scene. Chaos set to 6. To be continued…
