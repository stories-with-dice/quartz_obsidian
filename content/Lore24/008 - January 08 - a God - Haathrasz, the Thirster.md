## Haathrasz, the Thirster

God: Haathrasz

- Porfolio: Life
- Modes and Epithets: See - Diviner

Haathrasz is one of the Eternals, the "Ancient Weepers," the "Seedlings." 

It isn't so much an entity as a pervasive force that shapes and controls creation, with some sort of intentionality and consciousness that we cannot really understand. Where we begin, it ends; where it ends, we end. There is no life outside Haathrasz, there is no Haathrasz outside the Universe. 

To say that Haathrasz *is* life is also erroneous. The relationship between It and life is like the one between the observer and the observed, with the added complication that the observer somehow is the observed. Wherever there arises complexity, there is Haathrasz already, waiting and calculating. *What is this life? Why is it here? What should I do with it?*

When it notices life emerging -- of any form -- Haathrasz coalesces into it, and dives into the substructure. It traversez up and down, feasting and drinking from the fountain of life. For as much as It is powerful, Haathrasz cannot create life on its own; it only notices it *already* existing. 

Haathrasz follows the evolution of Life -- a bug, a bacteria, the human -- from its inception as an idea in the mind of the Universe (another Weeper?) to its apex and collapse into entropy.
