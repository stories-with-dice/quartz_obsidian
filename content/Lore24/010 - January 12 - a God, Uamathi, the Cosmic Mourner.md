What is the symbolism of Night in this context? I don't want it to be too similar to Boghost, the God of illusion above. I'm going to interpret Night as the dream world, the subconscious realm, as opposed to the mundane. 

Uamathi is the *Cosmic Mourner* [^4] that seeks to destroy and eradicate the creative aspects of humanity, with all its aspects: human communication, dance, art. Those mystics that claim to have communed with the great god-mind talk about an alien feeling of anger, almost jealousy. Uamathi is said to hate the creative aspects as it was creation that destroyed the previous universes that it has inhabited, with everything that it had held dear.
