The Var are an old race of alien monsters that sent their spies to Earth many eons ago. These pioneers were sent to Earth to mine it for precious resources.

> `Faction resources: Medicine: Knowledge of anatomy and resources to heal, cure, or prevent diseases or injuries`

Specifically, they studied life on Earth in order to build a catalogue of known diseases and injuries. The Var are an old race, and, with the eons, they grew paranoid and hypochondriac. They could not leave their home planet of Jevyon Yor

Within Earth's depths they built elaborate laboratories to study the flora and fauna. They catalogued it and sent many of their findings to their home planet. They were ecstatic with their findings on our planet. However, with time, the life's sheer amount of diseases and mutations overwhelmed even their advanced computers and intelligences. The scout scientists went mad trying to understand and predict its randomness. They stopped sending regular information back home.

Cut to: today, [Kova borehole](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole), Russia. Engineers pick up signs of extensive underground spaces that don't seem natural. They send robots to study it. The robots retrieve "strange artifacts". One of the robots' video feed cuts abruptly when a "gust of wind" pushes it over the brink of a chasm.

**Hooks**

- A Russian oligarch snatches a few of the artifacts recovered from the Kova expedition. He's hired a team of biologists and chemists to extract the information from the Var's supercomputers. What secrets lurk in there? What lessons will the scientists learn? What sort of effects will this knowledge have on the human body?
- A further expedition is being prepared into the underground complexes, funded by the Russian, Chinese and US governments. Representatives from each country are being assigned to the team. 
- The Var have grown concerned over the radio silence. They are now sending a new wave of scientists to find out what happened to the first landers. NASA has picked up strange objects at the edge of the Solar System, moving unlike any other celestial body. Doomsday cults have already popped up, heralding the return of Nibiru.
