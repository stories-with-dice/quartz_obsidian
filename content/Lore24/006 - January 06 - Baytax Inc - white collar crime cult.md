> Turning point:
> - PHYSICAL CONTEST OF SKILLS    _(ACTION)_
>     - This Turning Point involves Characters squaring off against each other in a physical contest of skills. This can be anything such as combat, a sporting event, duel, arm wrestling contest, etc.
> - JUST CAUSE GONE AWRY    _(SOCIAL)_
>     - This Turning Point involves something that began as a just cause but has spiraled into something unjust. For instance, a hero takes down a group of orcs terrorizing a town, saving the people, but now the hero has installed himself as the overlord of the town and is demanding tribute.
> - SOMETHING LOST HAS BEEN FOUND    _(MYSTERY)_
>     - Something that has been lost turns up in this Turning Point. The thing could have been lost in this Adventure or before. It can be an object, a person, or anything. For instance, a ring of power suddenly turns up in a creek bed, or a Character who disappeared early in the Adventure suddenly makes a reappearance.
> - DISARMED    _(TENSION)_
>     - A Character loses their primary method of defending themselves. This could mean the loss of a weapon, or maybe a powerful bureaucrat is powerless in anotherâ€™s kingdom, etc. The disarmament should be temporary for the Turning Point and deprive the Character of crucial defenses.
> - NONE

Name: Baytax Inc.

History: The group dates back to **Schulte Law** formed by [[January 2024 Character Creation Challenge#04 - Roger Schulte|Roger Schulte]] as his private law practice and tax advisory service, in Chicago. It was soon redirected by force by the Mickey Raza Family criminal outfit to launder their money and provide legal advice. Roger attempoted to change his identity and moved to New Orleans. However, this didn't work. The hired bodyguards were dumped on his office doorsteps, etched in their necks the sign of the Mickey Raza Family gang. 

Acquiescing to the pressure, Roger dedicated himself to growing this illicit side of business. He grew to appreciate it as a lucrative side hustle to his daytime casework. 

As part of his money laundering fronts, Roger purchased many local businesses. One such acquisition was a local pawnshop with a reputation for the occult and weird. During an inspection of the business, Roger discovered a ...

... From the darkness of the shop, a figure appeared. Roger chocked. His heart pounded in his ears.

Returning to his office, he hired extensive detectives and academics to track down the powder and its origin. Throughout the next year, Roger divested more and more funds to his occult interests. One day, the gangs that have been paying him will take notice...

**Methods**. 

`Discovery: Search of lost artifacts, hidden knowledge, and secrets`

Take money from criminal gangs for laundering and investment. Divest it to occult research and purchases. 

**Resources**

`Diplomacy: Good reputation, network, or alliances to negotiate, cooperate, or trade with others`

Criminal connections. Roger has made friends with many of the local and regional gangs. He can call on most of these for favors or jobs.

Occult treasures. With his vast funds, Roger has managed to acquire plenty of occult times. While most of these are mundane, a few hold secret powers. 

**Hooks**

Unfortunately, Roger doesn't understand what the items are or do. He doesn't trust the external detectives and consultants to keep them on the payroll long enough. 

Furthermore, the gangs suspect Roger is hiding something. They have surveillance on him and have noticed the strangers coming and going from his office.
