## Silent Legions Pantheon

What is the nature of The Void (The Unnatural, The Strange) in my world? Where did it come? What does it want? Does it *want* at all?

Let's create some Gods using the [Silent Legions](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145769/Silent-Legions?affiliate_id=1026766) book.

**Creating Gods**

- Major Deities: 1d4+2, but few with any connection to the others -> `1d4: [1] = 1`+2 = 3 
- Pantheon Traits: 
	- Distant. The gods interact with the world only through their minions.
	- Relicts. The gods come from a former age of reality, when things were different.

The Gods of this Universe [^1] are ignorant of humanity. They also inhabit spaces and shapes that cannot interact with our four-dimensional reality. The Gods do not exist in the same sense we *exist.* For humanity, existence is struggle, existence is uncertainty. For the Gods it is impossible to say what existence could *feel like.* Perhaps they are the physical forces that imploded our Universe into existence to begin with, that expand it further, and that eat it away slowly, cold entropy its leftovers. 

When they do manifest with the confines of our reality, they are perceived as "inhabiting" a body -- monstruous, but still a body. Human perception is limited to the window of the four dimensions, so we perceive everything through those limitations. The effect is similar to what Alan Watts described in "The Book":

> Here is someone who has never seen a cat. He is looking through a narrow slit in a fence, and, on the other side, a cat walks by. He sees first the head, then the less distinctly shaped furry trunk, and then the tail. [...] Thereupon he reasons that the event head is the invariable and necessary cause of the event tail, which is the headâ€™s effect. This absurd and confusing gobbledygook comes from his failure to see that head and tail go together; they are all one cat. - Alan Watts, "The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are"

The Gods are "leftovers" from the Universe's unending cycle of birth, expansion, and destruction -- the accumulated entropy and momentum. They remember the previous iterations, as we remember and learn from our childhood growing up. 

**Human perspective**

Occultists of this world refer to these entities as the "Eternals", due to their transcending the Universe itself. In the typical anthropomorphizing, humans ascribe their own emotions to the Gods. Some wizards dubbed the entities as "Ancient Weepers", akin to an immortal who he sees their family and friends perish of old age. Scientists puzzled by the mystery of creation and entropy have posited the existence of a "Sine Qua Non" particle that kickstarted the Big Bang itself -- the "Seed".
