This is a sect dedicated to the preservation of the forest that I'm going to use in a work-in-progress Call of Cthulhu module.

**Name:** various, changes across time and place: The Mother's Children, Saviors of the Green, Forest Protection Radicals

**Origins:** Ever since the forest could scream from the fires of man, the committed heard and rallied to protect her precious green. With the dawn of industrialization the scream grew deafening for the Mother's chosen. Their methods grew brazen as man's hubris grew dangerous.

**Methods:** The sect worships Shub-Niggurath and her many nature aspects throughout history (Astarte, Cybele, Danu, Artemis, Feyja, Demeter). They settle in forests they deem endangered by "modern man" (a term they use with derision in their pamphlets and tomes) and bless them. The blessing is a ritual sacrifice in which they spill "modern" blood on chosen tree. Once enough has been spilt, the tree grows into a protector.

**Resources:** 

Sympathy. Today, due to the climate movement, the group has been able to attract and recruit at an unprecedented scale. However, not all those who are interested are taught the Magna Mater's secrets. Some are kept as ignorant tools, to do the bidding of the masters.

Talent and crafts. The cult has always attracted those in touch with their artistic and creative side. The dawn of industrialization brought on the Romantic movement as a diametric opposite. Poets, novelists, painters are all obsessed with nature and its power. The cult uses these gifted individuals as channelers of Mother's wishes. Additionally, they use the goods the create as an additional source of income.
