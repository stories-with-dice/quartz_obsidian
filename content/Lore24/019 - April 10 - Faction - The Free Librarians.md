## Faction - The Free Librarians

This is a group that can be used in any modern horror campaign.

The main concept is a group that operates within public libraries. They leave hidden messages within shelves and meet at odd hours to discuss and share secret knowledge.

The leader is Chloe Zhukov, a disgraced literary studies PhD. She had to leave academia as she was discovered to have been using and spread pirated copies of academic books. She now works as a librarian. Her secret desire is to write and publish a book about guerilla warfare that will land her a fat check, so she can finally retire.

Resources: They have managed to obtain leaked copies of top secret government documents outlining anatomical representations of aliens. The group has copied these and placed them in various public libraries. Unknown to them, the government (perhaps Delta Green?) is on their tails.

Current operations: They are currently fighting a silent academic war with the Miskatonic University circle. The Free Librarians post on social media condemning the MU circle of "gatekeeping" by not allowing external researchers to access the MU's much-renowned "forbidden section."
