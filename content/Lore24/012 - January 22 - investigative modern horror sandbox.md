What do we need to have in our world's assumptions for a sandbox modern horror game?

The closest we have in current RPGs is Unknown Armies. However, the horror there is centered around humanity. *We did it!*

How can we apply that logic to a Lovecraftian supernatural horror game to make it *about the PCs?* Again, Silent Legions to the rescue (partly). The book suggests creating a region and then filling it with aliens, monsters, gangs, and cults. But that's a bit strange to me. Or a bit in the wrong direction. Because 1) generally, in Lovecraftian fiction, horror works when it's sparse; 2) why would the PCs get involved? 

I think the assumptions should be along the a different perspective:

- the PCs *matter*. What they want and do should be important and pro-active (not reactive, as in most investigative RPGs)
- horror is de-facto reality. It cannot be the exception. For this, we need to extrapolate and reach the logical conclusion of something like Cthulhu City or Cthulhu Apocalypse: *evil has won*.
- alternative spin on the horror: Gods *care* about humanity for some reason. Whatever we do is important to them; human emotions and despair are treasured and *interesting*. This is what Kult does and I love it. 

Thus what we get is a sort of "urban survival horror RPG".

Plots and frameworks are the bread and butter, so here are some:

- you are the last remnants of humanity within a small town, you want to search for other communities, while also removing any subverters and horrors hiding among your midst
- you are part of a criminal network in a dark metropolis. You want the Eldritch powers because you think that they can provide the only means to save the world (or will you give in to their temptation for personal power?)
- you are Spec Ops soldiers, part of the last fighting force of humanity. You are lost behind enemy lines, where you need to blend in, sneak, kill. Either find your way back home or dig deeper to kill the ultimate evil of the region
