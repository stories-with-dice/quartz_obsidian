Today I want to articulate what I'm aiming to building in this series. My main themes are:
- the city
and
- the void

While those are quite broad, they contain in themselves a multitude of sub-themes and ideas. My main idea is horror mixed with aspects of urban decay, decadence, corruption. The Void on the other hand, represents the Other, the Unnatural, piercing the Illusion. 

Which city? Any city, really. I can't commit to one city. These strands of lore should be easily moved between any modern, contemporary city.
