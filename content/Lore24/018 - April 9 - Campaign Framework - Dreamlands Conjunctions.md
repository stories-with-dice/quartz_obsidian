## Campaign framework - Dreamlands Conjunctions

Reality is shaped by belief, a la Planescape or [Department of Truth](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/the-department-of-truth). In hidden fringe corners of the world cultists control and subtly guide those susceptible to various ideas to their own ends. They shape reality and summon forth creatures from the Dreamlands. Their goals? Mysterious, elusive, but dangerous. You play agents trying to stop them. 

This framework allows me to combine modern day with magical fantasy incursions, similar to [Project Staircase](https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/setting-riff-voices-from-below-and-the-long-stairs.391379/), **without** worrying about having to research and represent modern realism. In these corners, belief in Yeti or The Mothman have altered reality to new magical rules. 

An example could be a system of otherwise mundane caves believed by locals to house spirits of the dead animals in the area. The theme of the location would be exploring loss of innocence and animal companionship.
