## Epistemological bottleneck

The unnatural is above and below our reality. Its true nature cannot be perceived in our four dimensional world. Thus, any intrusion, traversal, or intersection manifests in idiosyncratic ways. It is *reduced* to our physics. The human mind is another **epistemological bottleneck**. It simply *cannot* perceive the real and absolute. It shapes it, filters it, changes it, in order to process it. Whatever we see as a demon is not the actual form. We see it and understand it with our own cultural and psychological baggage. The same unnatural manifestations across history were seen as different things as cultures changed: the will of Gods in ancient Greece, demons and witchcraft in medieval Europe, UFOs and aliens in the late 20th century.

I'm quite proud of the phrase "epistemological bottleneck."
