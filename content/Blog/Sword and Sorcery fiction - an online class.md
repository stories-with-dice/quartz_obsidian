I am currently taking the online class in Sword and Sorcery fiction, from the Storytelling Collective (https://www.storytellingcollective.com/courses/take/write-your-first-sword-and-sorcery/texts/43538965-lesson-1-activity)

I will post my notes and activities in this blog post.
# Activity 1 

- What are some of your favorite sword and sorcery characters or stories?
	- The Elric novels are my personal favorite. Conan is also great, but lacks the depth.
- What is it you like most about these characters or stories?
	- I like the doomed fate aspect of the character. I also like how his main sources of power -- Stormbringer and his magical powers -- have heavy downsides. The theme of cosmic balance is also really intriguing.
- What _non-sword and sorcery_ media are you influenced by (books, comics, TV, movies, games, music, artwork, etc.)?
	- Modern crime (The Wire, True Detective, Se7en, Better Call Saul)
	- Sci-fi/cyberpunk media (Philip K. Dick, Peter Watts, Three Body Problem, Ghost in the Shell, The Expanse)
	- Literary novels (John Fowles, Jonathan Franzen, Moby Dick, James Joyce)
	- Post-modern philosophy (Nietzsche, Camus, literary theory)
	- Cold war history and "weird" history (conspiracies, spirituality, fringe cultures)
- What do you like most about these media that you might draw on in your own sword and sorcery stories?
	- a crime procedural-like structure/plot. Perhaps a detective main character. Or a more realistic depictions of crime and criminals 
	- framing the supernatural as "sufficiently advanced technology". Perhaps the gods are nothing more than advanced AIs leftover from the apocalypse of contemporary society.
	- Subversion of tropes. Introduction of literary techniques and pastiche. A meta-fictional awareness of the genre
	- Themes of existentialism, lack of meaning, cosmic indifference.
	- a historical setting. Aspects of the setting inspired by real history (two nations locked into a cold war with "magic nukes")
- Is there a particular culture or region of the world you identify with?
	- I'm from Romania. I have published [a RPG sourcebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/454061/Romanian-Mythos--Sourcebook-for-Cthulhu-Eternal) based on my country's culture and legacy. 
- Are there many sword and sorcery stories told from the perspective of that culture or region?
	- Not that I know. We do have myths and folklore that involve heroes slaying monsters ([example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A2slea_the_Brave_and_the_Golden_Apples))
