This is an alternative of [[Cthulhu Eternal - Custom Rules for Motivations]].

## Design Goals
- Offer a re-roll mechanic
- The re-roll mechanic should connect to the PC's Motivations
- Re-rolling is mentally exhausting for the PC
- Running out of Motivation is risky
## Character Creation Rules
- PCs can assign points to their Motivations, similar to Bonds
- They sum up their INT, POW, and CHA, and can distribute those among their five Motivations
- Motivations should be formulated as values, fears, passions, or goals

**Example**

Carla is a street fighter that cares about her little brother and community in general but also wants fame as an accomplish fighter. Her stats are STR 17, CON 12, DEX 12, INT 11, POW 10, CHA 10. The player can distribute the 11+10+10 (31) points to her Motivations as

- Value: Do what's best for her family 11
- Goal: Make a name for herself as a street fighter 6
- Passion: Take risks 3
- Goal: Continue her education 5
- Value: Contribute to her neighborhood's community 6

## Game Rules

- when a PC fails a skill check, they may re-roll
- the re-roll is only allowed if the action can be contextualized within one of the PC's Motivations (pending GM approval)
	- if the action itself is not immediately relevant within a Motivation, the PC may still roll, but they need to either a) spend one of the next Downtimes dedicated to that Motivation; b) seek to immediately do something related to that Motivation that is dangerous, reckless or ill-advised
- the GM decides the Difficulty Die of the re-roll
	- Easy tasks: 1D4; Average tasks: 1D6; Hard Tasks: 1D8
- the PC rolls the Difficulty Die and subtracts the amount from their WP
	- if the re-roll fails, they subtract the same amount from their Motivation
	- if the re-roll succeeds, they only subtract 1 from the relevant Motivation
- they may not push the same action twice
- if the Motivation reaches 0, the PC must roll a SAN check. If they fail, they suffer a Temporary Insanity episode (after the skill check is resolved)
- the current rule of recovering WP through following a Motivation is removed

### Downtime: Personal Motivations

This replaces the rules for the "Personal Motivation" downtime action.

- the PC reduces a Bond by 1
- the PC rolls a SAN test
- Success adds 1D4 to a Motivation
	- Critical adds 1D6
- Failure removes 1 from a Motivation
	- Fumble reduces 1D4
