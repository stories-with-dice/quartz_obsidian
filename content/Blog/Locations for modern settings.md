The problem I have sometimes with running modern locations is that I want an adventure site, similar to a dungeon, but "themed" to a modern realistic environment. Over the games I've run I've developed a list of semi-successful "types" of locations.

I use these in combinations with the [[Obsidian Random Tables - Worlds without Number]] Ruin tags to create interesting locations for my modern horror games.

(Roll 1d20)

1. **abandoned subway system**
2. **derelict mental hospital**
3. **secret biotech laboratory**
4. **crumbling high-rise**
5. **sports and concerts arena**
6. **catacombs beneath the city**
7. **decommissioned military bunker**
8. **sewer network**
9. **abandoned theme park**
10. **closed-down mall**
11. **old lighthouse on a remote island**
12. **dilapidated boarding school**
13. **secret underground railway**
14. **ghost town**
15. **corporate penthouse**
16. **cocaine plantation and processing facility**
17. **community garden sanctuary**
18. **gang hideout under a church**
19. **survivalist bunker**
20. **luxury yacht adrift at sea**

For example, I roll 2 for **derelict mental hospital**. I mix this with the random ruin tag of **False Front** and I get

This is forgotten mental asylum that has been passed down through generations of a rich family of sorcerers. The family has been using to hide away their mad members. Whenever journalists or the public inquired, they would be silenced, or would be dismissed by saying that the asylum was "full" and that no new members could be accepted. Five years ago the last "sane" member of the family passed away. Now, with no one to pay for the asylum's staff and maintenance, the crazed members of the family (sorcerers, half-mutants) are free to roam!
