Within the context of BRP games like [Call of Cthulhu](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/150997/Call-of-Cthulhu-7th-Edition--Keepers-Rulebook?affiliate_id=1026766), [Delta Green](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/236576/Delta-Green-The-RolePlaying-Game?affiliate_id=1026766) or [Cthulhu Eternal](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/384110/Cthulhu-Eternal--Modern-Age-SRD?affiliate_id=1026766), I don't like having separate languages as skills. Instead, I'm going to go the D&D route. 

There is only one **Language** skill. 

- For every 20% points assigned, you can pick another language. 
- You can speak, read, write all such languages at an "adequate" level
- If the language is "exotic" (Akkadian, Coptic, Egyptian etc.), you need to make an INT check (*hey everyone, remember INT*?) every time you use it, +/- 10%/20% depending on "rarity"
- You know your native language without needing to put any points in Language
