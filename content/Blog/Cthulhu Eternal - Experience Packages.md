# Wealth

Your character is very wealthy and money is a minor concern in their everyday life because they have enough of it. Examples: Successful business owner, rich heiress.

**Benefit:** All of your character's expenses are treated as one expense category lower than usual.

**Disadvantage:** Delete a Bond.

# Poverty/debt

You are poor as a church mouse, and maybe you also have a lot of debt. But as we all know, money alone doesn't make you happy. At least you have solid bonds!

**Benefit:** Your character gains an additional bond.

**Disadvantage:** All of your character's expenses are treated as one expense category higher than usual.

# Status

Your character is famous or recognized within certain circles. People recognize them when they meet them and have a high opinion of them. This recognition has great personal value. Perhaps people are simply subordinate to the character because they has a higher rank or status. Examples: A musician and her fans. A professor and the scientific community. A noblewoman and her subjects. A horror writer and her fans.

**Benefit:** +20% to social checks against admirers and people of lower status.

**Disadvantage:** -20% on social checks to remain anonymous or when using a false identity. The character always expects to meet a fan or critic and be recognized.
