This is an experiment with [Silent Legions](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145769/Silent-Legions) and starting from a map. I’m also going to be using Emmy Allen’s one-roll combat rules [here](http://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/2018/03/one-roll-fights.html)

I also use damage scaling.
- x2 damage outgoing from party
- /2 damage incoming to party

Stumbled across this map. I immediately felt inspired to start a noir / modern horror game.

We arrive at a warehouse on the outskirts of the city.

> [!info]-  Why are we here?

> Meaning (action):

We are here because we were hired to protect someone. 

We find a trail of blood.

We trace it to a container.

Inside is a bleeding man. He is a journalist. “I specialize in the weird. [[Character List#Patrick, scientist at corporation]]-  hired me to come here. He was going to show something”

This is [[Character List#Stilton Miter, journalist of the weird]]

“What happened here?”

> [!info]-  Does he trust us?
> 🎲 2d6+1 -> [3, 5]+1 -> 9 
> YES

“They attacked Patrick and knifed me.“

We see he is bleeding. 

“They took him inside” he says, and then runs away. “Good luck!”

We sneak around to peer inside the window.

> Sneak is successful.

> FEROCIOUSLY SMELLY

> That’s …. perfect.

Inside we see a warehouse of massive containers, with a strong pungent smell. 

> [!info]-  enemies?
> 
> 4 or 3
> > Fate check (likely):
> YES
> 
> 4.

We see the scientist, Patrick. He is tied to a chair and being beaten by one of the thugs. 

“What did you say to the reporter?”

Turns out, the scientist hired the reporter and us to come here so he can show us the corporation’s warehouse (this warehouse) and its illegal science experiments. The thugs captured him and are now beating him.

The scientist finally confesses and says that we (Bobbie and Thomas) are expected to arrive now.

One of the thugs begins patrolling the area.

> [!info]-  Does he come outside?
> 
> > Fate check (has to be):
> EXTREME YES
> event - REMOTE - INQUIRE _(of)_ A_BURDEN

The thug exits the backdoor. Bobbie sets up an ambush to whack him over the head. 

> [!info]-  Ambush
> 10 yes 
> 
> whack over the head
> 3 fails

The thug is hit over the head but doesn’t pass out. He instead turns around and rushes Bobbie. Thomas steps out from behind the corner and attempts to backstab him.

> [!info]-  does the scream of the thug alert the others inside?
> > Fate check (unlikely):
> NO

> [!info]-  backstab
> 10 yes

the thug bleeds out and dies. 

> [!info]-  Madness from Violence.

> 🎲 __20__ /D20
> that’s max! yikes! 

Thomas is a delicate scholar, he didn’t expect to stab and murder someone this evening. 

Thomas stabs the thug in the ribs. As the man crumbles to a fetal position and perishes, Thomas is in a state of shock. Bobbie snaps him out of it

“We have to get that man out of there!”

> 
> their side
> + 1 highest hit die

We first try to flank them. 

> [!info]-  Stealth to flank
> 7 yes

Bobbie moves around them to strike from the other side, from the dark. 

> [!info]-  trap?
> 🎲 2d6 -> [3, 4]-  -> 7
> yes

Bobbie also sets up a bucket of bricks to fall on a thug if they chase them into one of the corners.

> [!info]
> them 🎲 __3__ /D6 vs 🎲 __3__ /D6
> tie!

The fight is bloody and quick. Two thugs chase Bobbie into the corner. The bucket hits one, taking him out. The other knocks the wind out of the chain-smoking PI’s lungs.

The other thug jumps me, but Thomas stabs him. Thomas is still in shock due to the earlier violent episode. In his absent-minded state, he loses control and lashes out at the man, cutting his face. He runs away.

> [!info]-  damage
> Thomas, worst save 16 → 🎲 __3__ /D20 failed → takes 3 damage → 1 damage
> Bobbie, worse save 16 → 🎲 __8__ /D20 → takes 8 damage → 4 damage
> 

Thomas then helps Bobbie take out the final thug, but notices he is deeply bleeding from a gut wound. I help him up.

We barely get the scientist out of there while the thugs recover. We flee the warehouse as the thugs also flee to their car and one calls for backup (or a boss?)

We try to hide in a dark alley while the heat dissipates.

> [!info]
> 🎲 2d6+2 -> [1, 6]+2 -> 9

The thugs scour the neighborhood to find us, but we hide in a dumpster with the scientist. We wait there for a few hours. 

We then get to our car, and drive to our office. 

Upcoming… talking with the scientist, Patrick, about what he knows!
